Title: A night in Nowhere
Scene: two weary humanoids decided to take a cruise into the gas, grub,
and gambling town known as Nowhere. A town that if you have to ask where
it's at you'll never find it and if you don't need to ask than you know where to go.
It's dark, dank, and riddled with hustlers, high rollers, and hypocrites. Its
on the outer rim of the galaxy and is the last stop before heading into the dark
abyss of space. Going beyond Nowhere is a sure fire way of never coming back so if
you're looking to get gone then gone is where you'll end up if you pass through
Nowhere. For our two travelers sake though they have no intentions of gettin' gone
for good, but need to get away from where they're at in Elsewhere. A hustling bustling
city with a population of 2.6 million humanoid creatures that call it home.
 
Now our two travelers whose name are harder spell and even harder to say because the
dialect is an archaic english language that is rarely used and when it is it's usually to
curse. Most languages spoken sound like Jabba the Hut when he's getting choked by Princess Leia in Star Wars.
But at any rate our travelers are known as Charlie and Paul.
 
This is the story of Charlie and Paul's venture to Nowhereâ€¦
